#TODO 10
- make light button open a dropdown with Pointlight, DirectionalLight, HemisphericLight
- add property panel for lights to adjust color diffuse and specular for all 3 types and groundColor for HemisphericLight
- add property panel for lights to adjust location for Pointlight
- add property panel for lights to adjust direction for DirectionalLight and HemisphericLight
- show different simple 3d representations for each light type
- a new scene should have a default light (HemisphericLight)

- allow enabling disabling skybox (implement in global settings modal)
var createScene = function () {
    var scene = new BABYLON.Scene(engine);
    var camera = new BABYLON.ArcRotateCamera("Camera", -Math.PI / 2,  Math.PI / 2, 5, BABYLON.Vector3.Zero(), scene);
    camera.attachControl(canvas, true);

	var light = new BABYLON.HemisphericLight("hemiLight", new BABYLON.Vector3(-1, 1, 0), scene);
	light.diffuse = new BABYLON.Color3(1, 0, 0);

	// Skybox
	var skybox = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateBox("skyBox", {size:1000.0}, scene);

#DONE

#TODO 1
- the scroll wheel is not working it should zoom in and out of the canvas
- right click should pan the canvas
- the magnetic lock should lock the sides of objects, not center it should not make objects overlap
- split index.js into the builder-scene.js and builder-ui.js
- add a cursor on the canvas clicking on the grid will select the update the selected cell
- remove the drag and drop functionality for adding objects to the canvas, instead clicking on an object should add it to the center of the selected cell
- double clicking on an object should make the camera center on that object and zoom in

#TODO 2
- make snapping to grid optional (toggle button in the UI)
- make snapping to other objects optional (toggle button in the UI)
- snapping should look at all corner combinations and snap the closest one and only choose the one that doesnt make objects overlap
- all added objects to the canvas should have a name property that can be edited
- add a property panel for selected objects, where user can edit position (x,y,z), rotation, scale (x and y)
- implement undo and redo functionality
- create a new js file for managing the objects
- create a new js file for the property panel UI

#TODO 3
- all file names start with category_name... group the files into collapsible panels with the category name
- in the asset-item for label remove the .glb extension and the first categoryname from the label.
- when giving the objects name use the full filename except the extension but add a _1 _2 etc. to make the names unique
in the grid make the current size 50% smaller for how each grid size is rendered

- bug: undo doesnt work properly after deleting an object or moving an object

#TODO 5

- make pan and zoom with mouse only work when ctrl key is pressed
- enable multi-selection of objects, shift key to be pressed to use mouse for multi-selection
- allow moving multiple selected objects at the same time
- allow deleting multiple selected objects at the same time
- when multiple objects are selected highlight all of the selected objects
- when multiple objects are selected in property panel show a list of all selected objects
- allow duplicating multiple selected objects at the same time (duplicate button in the property panel when multiple objects are selected)

#TODO 6

- when adding new objects if an object is already selected add the new object on top of the selected object
- allow user to lock existing objects so they cant be moved or deleted (in property panel add a lock toggle)
- allow user to select multiple objects and lock them all at once
- save current map to local storage so it persists between sessions (checkbox in global settings modal to enable/disable this feature, enabled by default)
- allow to add a grid of objects, when adding right click on the objects sidebar add an option to add a grid of objects (specify rows and columns), the objects should touch each other without gaps
- when multiple objects are selected in the properties menu add 3 button set X, Y and Z to same values
- make the add grid use html modal not alert inputs

#TODO 7
- BUG: when adding objects on top of another there is a visible gap between them.
- when multiple objects are select instead of x,y,z add 2 for each align to the min or max of each use the highest/lowest value of selected objects.
- add buttons to align tops, align bottoms of selected objects
- BUG: when pressing ctrl or alt make sure the window is in focus so the keypresses are detected properly and alt-tab doesnt trigger alt keypress in the app
- add color tint property to property panel for objects
- add x,y,x arrows above the selected asset on the canvas. to move the asset the user needs to drag one of the arrows. dont allow user to drag the object itself.
- when duplicating an object keep it closer to the original
- when duplicating an object the textures, scale and rotation doesnt duplicate they should be identical to the original.
- objects should cast shadows on each other not just the ground plane
- in property editor for both single and selected objects add three icons for drag (currently exist), scale (x,y,z) and rotate  (x,y,z), scale and rotate should show ui similar to the 3 arrows for drag, rotate should show circles the user can use the mouse to rotate for each dimension
- remove the auto snap to grid,objects feature
- when multiple elements are selected add buttons to space side by side in x,y,z so there wont be any gap in the direction the user choose between the objects
- when clicking on undo/redo reselect the current selected objects but verify that they exist after the undo.
- in the property panel make the position, rotation and scale inputs be side by side not stacked for each
- when multiple objects are selected for position, rotation, scale only allow user to edit in property panel for all selected objects similar to the way they are moved
- when multiple objects are selected allow user to change color for all in property panel
- make undo/redo work with keyboard shortcuts ctrl+z and ctrl+y

#TODO 8
- create a new js file for managing object groups called tree-view.js
- add a object tree view that can be turned collapsed or full height of the screen. it will use absolute positioning on the right side of the screen and show on top of the canvas when open. it will show all objects and groups in a hierarchical view.
- add object grouping functionality, allow user to group multiple selected objects into a single group (add group button in property panel when multiple objects are selected)
- only allow one level of grouping (no nested groups)
- groups are for management dont add any hierarchy to the scene itself
- clicking on an object or group in the tree view will select it in the canvas
- allow renaming groups in the tree view
- allow user to select multiple objects in the tree view using shift key
- when user clicks on a group name in the tree view it will select all objects inside that group on the tree view and the canvas
- allow deleting groups from tree view (deleting a group will not delete the objects inside just ungroup them)

BUG: deleting an asset breaks the tree view with error
- allow user to drag an asset on the tree view into a group to add it to that group
- allow user to drag an asset out of a group to ungroup it
- groups should be collapsible in the tree view
- allow selecting multiple groups
- disable text selection in the tree view when clicking and dragging to select multiple items as it is confusing

- redesign the sidebar so map controls are moved to a new menu bar on the top of the application and create a status bar at the bottom of the application both are always visible, map builder assets should be like scene objects and collapsible on the left side of the application

- locked items on the canvas should not be selectable from the canvas only treeview should select them
- in tree view show icon next to locked items
- make grid lines thinner
